`clamp(min=0)` does the same work as ReLU:
```python
# Forward pass: compute predicted y using operations on Variables; these
# are exactly the same operations we used to compute the forward pass using
# Tensors, but we do not need to keep references to intermediate values since
# we are not implementing the backward pass by hand.
y_pred = x.mm(w1).clamp(min=0).mm(w2)
```
