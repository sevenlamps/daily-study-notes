# Training a neural network
A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:
Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)
Iterate over a dataset of inputs
Process input through the network
Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)
Propagate gradients back into the networkâ€™s parameters
Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient
